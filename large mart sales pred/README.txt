Sales data for 1559 products across 10 stores in different cities. Also, certain attributes of each product and store have been defined. The aim is to build a predictive model and predict the sales of each product at a particular outlet.
Using this model, BigMart can understand the properties of products and outlets which play a key role in increasing sales.
Here the data may have missing values as some stores might not report all the data due to technical glitches. Hence, it is required to treat them accordingly.
